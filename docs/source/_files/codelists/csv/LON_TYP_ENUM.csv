"CRD","Credit-card loan","
            Credit granted via delayed debit cards, i.e. cards providing
            convenience credit, or via credit cards, i.e. cards providing
            convenience credit and extended credit.  Convenience credit is the
            credit granted at an interest rate of 0% in the period between the
            payment transactions made with the card during one billing cycle
            and the date at which the debit balances from this specific billing
            cycle become due.  Extended credit it credit granted after the due
            dates of the previous billing cylces have passed, i.e. debit
            amounts on the card account that have not been settled when this
            was first possible, for which an interest rate or tiered interest
            rates usually greater than 0% are charged.

"OVR","Overdraft","
            Where a deposit account has an overdraft facility and subsequently
            becomes overdrawn, the withdrawal to zero is the withdrawal of a
            deposit (recorded in the DEPOSIT relevant tables) and the amount of
            overdraft is recorded in the LOAN relevant tables.
            "
"REV","Revolving loans","
            Revolving loans are loans, excluding overdrafts and credit card
            debt, obtained through a line of credit and not yet repaid, where
            funds can be repeatedly repaid and drawn again (whether in one
            amount or in installments) up to an agreed contractual credit
            limit.  Revolving loans have the following features:
                (a) the borrower may draw on the facility up to an agreed
                    amount without notifying the lender
                (b) the amount of available credit fluctuates as funds are
                    borrowed and repaid
                (c) the facility may be used repeatedly
                (d) there is no obligation to repay regularly
            A margin account in which the broker-dealer lends the investor cash
            to purchase securities is a revolving loan.

"FLS","Financial leases","
            Financial leases are defined in Regulation ECB/2013/33 as contracts
            under which the legal owner of a durable good (lessor) lends it to
            a third party (lessee) for most if not all of its economic life, in
            exchange for instalments covering the cost of the good and an
            imputed interest charge. The lessee, as the economic owner, enjoys
            all the benefits from the use of the good and incurs the costs and
            risks of ownership. In addition it is the lessee, as the economic
            owner, that must provide any necessary repair and maintenance of
            the good. For statistical purposes, financial leases are treated as
            loans from the lessor to the lessee, with payments treated as loan
            repayments rather than rentals on the asset. The durable goods
            which are the subject of the lease are recorded on the balance
            sheet of the lessee (and valued at the purchase price paid by the
            lessor). Hire-purchase agreements are considered a type of
            financial lease.

"NOS","Non-negotiable securities","
            Holdings of debt securities which are not negotiable and cannot be
            traded on secondary markets are recorded as loans. These are
            instruments where the transfer of legal ownership is subject to
            restrictions which imply that they cannot be marketed or, although
            they are technically negotiable, cannot be traded owing to the
            absence of an organised market. Non-negotiable instruments that
            subsequently become negotiable and can be traded on secondary
            markets should be reclassified as debt securities.
            "
"TRD","Traded loans","
            Loans that have de facto become negotiable are called traded loans.
            Where there is no evidence of secondary market trading in the
            traded loans, they are classified as loans. Otherwise, they are
            classified as debt securities.
            "
"SUB","Subordinated debt in the form of loans","
            These are non-negotiable instruments constituting a subsidiary
            claim on the issuer that can be exercised only after all
            higher-status claims (i.e. deposits, loans) have been satisfied,
            giving them some of the characteristics of equity. Subordinated
            debt is classified as either “loans” or “debt securities” according
            to the nature and characteristics of the financial instrument.
            "
"INT","Intragroup loans","
            For subsidiaries, financing via inter-company or funding can be
            classified either as inter-company lending or as capital endowments
            (equity) in a subsidiary. As with subordinated debt, positions
            should be classified according to the criteria of loan and equity
            instruments.

"RFC","Recource factoring","
            Factoring refers to a transaction whereby a financial institution,
            known as a factoring company, purchases accounts receivable (i.e.
            invoices) from a third party. Specifically, it is the sale of a
            firm’s (the factoring client’s) claims (in full or in part)
            recorded under accounts receivable (in the form of invoices),
            representing money due from its customers, to a factoring company.
            The factoring company buys the receivables at a price which is
            lower than the face value of the invoice, thereby effectively
            charging the applicable fees and interest. The factoring company
            manages the sales ledger and the collection of the accounts under
            the terms agreed by the factoring client (firm). The customers send
            their payments directly to the factoring company. Finance is
            therefore extended for the duration of the trade debt.
            In recourse factoring the risk of default by the customer is
            retained by the factoring client in which case the factoring
            company is able to hold the factoring client liable if a debtor is
            unable to pay.  In particular, in recourse factoring the factoring
            company buys the receivables at a discount to the face value of the
            invoice.  This discount is retained as collateral to cover the
            risks associated with the operation. Upon payment of the invoices
            by the customers, the factoring company transmits the proceeds net
            of the advanced cash and the applicable fees and interest charges
            to the factoring client.  The counterparty of the loan by the
            factoring company is the factoring client.

            non-recourse factoring the full risk of default by the customer is
            assumed by the factoring company and fees and interest are
            therefore charged immediately to the factoring client, who receives
            the full amount of the trade credit net of these charges. In this
            case the customers are the counterparty of the loan by the
            factoring company.
