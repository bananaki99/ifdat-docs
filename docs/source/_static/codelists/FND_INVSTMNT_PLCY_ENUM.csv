            Hedge funds mean any collective investment undertakings regardless
            of its legal structure under national laws, which apply relatively
            unconstrained investment strategies to achieve positive absolute
            returns, and whose managers, in addition to management fees, are
            remunerated in relation to the fund’s performance. For that
            purpose, hedge funds have few restrictions on the type of financial
            instruments in which they may invest and may therefore flexibly
            employ a wide variety of financial techniques, involving leverage,
            short-selling or any other techniques.  This definition also covers
            funds that invest, in full or in part, in other hedge funds
            provided that they otherwise meet the definition.
